        "D": "Visual content is not important for users who are blind."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Screen readers rely on text and text equivalents (like alt text) to convey information from non-text elements. They cannot interpret images or other non-text content directly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it insufficient to convey information using visual attributes alone, such as color or spatial location, when designing accessible content?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Screen readers cannot interpret visual styling and blind users may miss critical information.",
        "B": "Visual attributes increase the loading time of a webpage.",
